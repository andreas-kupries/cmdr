'\" The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
'\" manual entries.
'\"
'\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
'\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
'\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
'\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
'\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
'\"
'\" .BS
'\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
'\"	enclosed in one large box.
'\"
'\" .BE
'\"	End of box enclosure.
'\"
'\" .CS
'\"	Begin code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .CE
'\"	End code excerpt.
'\"
'\" .VS ?version? ?br?
'\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
'\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
'\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
'\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
'\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
'\"
'\" .VE
'\"	End of vertical sidebar.
'\"
'\" .DS
'\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .DE
'\"	End of indented unfilled display.
'\"
'\" .SO
'\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
'\"	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
'\"	by tabs.
'\"
'\" .SE
'\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
'\"
'\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
'\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
'\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
'\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
'\"	the option's class in the option database.
'\"
'\" .UL arg1 arg2
'\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Welcome to the Cmdr project, written by Andreas Kupries\&.
.PP
For availability please read \fICmdr - How To Get The Sources\fR\&.
.PP
This package implements \fIofficers\fR, the inner nodes of command
hierarchies\&.  Each officer can execute many actions, by delegating
them to their sub-ordinate actors, officers and privates\&.
.PP
This class is sub-class of \fBcmdr::actor\fR\&.
.SH "CLASS API"
The class API is not public\&. It is used internally by the framework
when parsing a command hierarchy specification to create the necessary
officer instances\&.
.PP
It is described here for use by developers maintaining,
modifying and extending the framework itself\&. A user of the framework
has no need for it\&.
.TP
\fB::cmdr::officer\fR \fBnew\fR \fIsuper\fR \fIname\fR \fIactions\fR
Create an auto-named instance of \fBcmdr::officer\fR\&.
.sp
\fINot used\fR\&.
.TP
\fB::cmdr::officer\fR \fBcreate\fR \fIobj\fR \fIsuper\fR \fIname\fR \fIactions\fR
Create a new instance of \fBcmdr::officer\fR, named \fIobj\fR\&.
Used by the DSL processing parts of the framework to instantiate officers\&.
.RS
.TP
object \fIsuper\fR
The instance command of the actor (officer actually) which contains the new officer\&.
.TP
string \fIname\fR
The user-visible name of the command\&.
.TP
script \fIactions\fR
The specification of the officer's subordinates\&.
Please read \fICmdr - Officer Specification Language\fR for the details\&.
.RE
.PP
.SH "INSTANCE API"
The instance API is not public\&. It is used internally by the framework
during the parsing of a command hierarchy specification to configure
the officer instances, and when processing a command line at runtime
to manage navigation of the hierarchy, word-completion, etc\&.
.PP
It is described here for use by developers maintaining,
modifying and extending the framework itself\&. A user of the framework
has no need for it\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBchildren\fR
This method returns a list containing the instance commands of the
subordinate actors managed by this officer\&.
See also method \fBknown\fR which returns a list of names\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBcomplete\fR \fIline\fR
This hook-method for the main shell is responsible for computing the
set of completions for the entered \fIline\fR\&.
.RS
.TP
string \fIline\fR
The command line to complete\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBcomplete-words\fR \fIparse\fR
This method is given the completion state \fIparse\fR of a partial
command line and returns a list of strings which are the valid
completions at this point\&.
.RS
.TP
dict \fIparse\fR
A dictionary holding the current completion state of a partial command
line\&.
.sp
-- TODO -- Describe the state fields and their meaning\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBcontinued\fR \fIline\fR
This hook-method for the main shell is responsible for the detection
of a continuation-line in the entered command \fIline\fR\&. It always
returns the boolean value \fBfalse\fR as the main shell does not
support continuation lines\&.
.RS
.TP
list \fIlist\fR
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBdefault\fR
This method returns the instance command of the subordinate to use
during command line processing if the first word does not specify a
known subordinate\&. An error is thrown if no such default was specified
for this officer\&. See also method \fBhasdefault\fR\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBdispatch\fR \fIcmd\fR
This hook-method for the main shell is responsible for the recognition
and execution of the supported commands\&.
.RS
.TP
string \fIcmd\fR
The command line containing the command to run\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBdo\fR ?\fIword\fR\&.\&.\&.?
This method parses the \fIword\fRs of the command line, matching them
to the sub-ordinates of the officer\&. When done without error it
recursively invokes the chosen sub-ordinate to continue processing\&.
.sp
This represents the "Dispatch" phase of command line processing\&.
.RS
.TP
string \fIword\fR
The words of the command line to parse and match to parameters\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBehandler\fR \fIcmd\fR
This method specifies a command prefix to wrap around the parsing of
the command line for the officer, and the execution of its action\&.
.RS
.TP
cmd-prefix \fIcmd\fR
A command prefix taking a single argument, a script\&. The command
prefix has to execute this script in its caller's context\&. The script
will parse words for the officer,m and perform its action\&. The command
prefix then has the responsbility to perform any custom cleanup action
required by the application using the framework to prevent leakage of
data between multiple commands executed one after the other (i\&.e\&. in
an interactive shell run by the framework)\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBexit\fR
This hook-method for the main shell returns a boolean value indicating
whether the main shell was stopped and has to exit (\fBtrue\fR), or
not (\fBfalse\fR)\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBextend\fR \fIpath\fR \fIarguments\fR \fIaction\fR
A convenience method to create a "private" command underneath this
officer, with the command name \fIpath\fR (a list of names)\&. Any
intermediate officers are created as needed\&. An error is thrown if any
of the intermediates already exist as a (non-extensible) private, or
if the last command already exists\&.
.sp
The arguments after the \fIpath\fR match the constructor of
privates in number and semantics\&.
.RS
.TP
script \fIpath\fR
The list of names specifying the route from this officer to the new
private\&. The last element is the name of the private command, while
the preceding names specify the intermediate officers\&.
.TP
script \fIarguments\fR
The specification of the private's parameters\&.
Please read \fICmdr - Parameter Specification Language\fR for the details\&.
.TP
cmd-prefix \fIaction\fR
The command prefix to invoke when this private is selected for
execution\&.  It takes a single argument, the instance command of the
hidden \fBcmdr::config\fR container holding the private's
parameters\&. The result of the action, if there is any, is ignored by
the framework\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBhas\fR \fIname\fR
This method returns a boolean value indicating if this officer has a
sub-ordinate of the given \fIname\fR (\fBtrue\fR), or not
(\fBfalse\fR)\&. See also method \fBlookup\fR\&.
.RS
.TP
string \fIname\fR
The name of the sub-ordinate to look for\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBhasdefault\fR
This method returns a boolean value indicating if this officer has a
default sub-ordinate (\fBtrue\fR), or not (\fBfalse\fR)\&. See also
method \fBdefault\fR\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBhelp\fR ?\fIprefix\fR?
This method returns the help information for the officer and its
subordinates\&. The \fIprefix\fR, if specified provides the name of the
officer within the help data\&. It defaults to the empty string\&.
The result of the command is a structure of the form
described in section \fBHelp Information\fR\&.
.RS
.TP
string \fIprefix\fR
The name to use for the officer within the generated help\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBknown\fR
This method returns a list containing the names of the subordinate
actors managed by this officer\&.
See also method \fBchildren\fR which returns a list of instance
commands\&.
See also method \fBlookup\fR to map names to instance commands\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBlearn\fR \fIscript\fR
This method takes a regular specification script and uses it to extend
the set of subordinates known to this officer\&. This is the same type
of script as used during construction, except here we dynamically
extend the officer\&.
.RS
.TP
script \fIactions\fR
The specification of the officer's additional subordinates\&.
Please read \fICmdr - Officer Specification Language\fR for the details\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBlookup\fR \fIname\fR
This method returns the instance command of the sub-ordinate with the
given \fIname\fR\&. An error is thrown if such a sub-ordinate does not
exist\&. See also method \fBhas\fR\&.
.RS
.TP
string \fIname\fR
The name of the sub-ordinate to look for\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBprompt1\fR
This hook-method for the main shell returns the primary prompt string
to use\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBprompt2\fR
This hook-method for the main shell returns the secondary prompt
string for use within a continuation\&. As the main shell does not
support continuation lines it should not be invoked ever, and thus
always throws an error should it be invoked\&.
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBreport\fR \fIwhat\fR \fIdata\fR
This hook-method for the main shell is responsible for the reporting
of the command results\&.
.sp
Its result is the empty string\&.
.RS
.TP
enum \fIwhat\fR
The result code of the command, one of \fBok\fR, or \fBfail\fR\&.
.TP
any \fIdata\fR
The result of the command, or an error message in case of failure\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB<officer>\fR \fBshell-exit\fR \fIconfig\fR
This is the backend for a private ending the main shell,
be it automatically created by the pacge, or by a user\&.
.sp
The argument is the \fBcmdr::config\fR
instance holding the parameters\&. The method does not
expect any and ignore it\&.
.PP
