.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Welcome to the Cmdr project, written by Andreas Kupries\&.
.PP
For availability please read \fICmdr - How To Get The Sources\fR\&.
.PP
This document is for users of the cmdr framework\&. It introduces the
domain-specific language for the specification of parameters in
detail\&.
.SH "RELATED SPECIFICATION DOCUMENTS"
.IP [1]
\fICmdr - Introduction to the Specification Language\fR

.PP
.SH "LANGUAGE REFERENCE"
.PP
The \fIparameter\fRs of \fIprivate\fRs are the heart of the
system, providing the space needed to transfer command arguments to
their implementations, and having the most attributes controlling
their behaviour\&.
.PP
This complexity is strongly mitigated by the use of sensible
defaults for each of the three possible kinds of parameter, i\&.e\&.
positional \fIinput\fRs, named \fIoption\fRs", and \fIstate\fR
hidden from the command line\&.
.PP
Each kind has its own construction command in the language for
\fIprivate\fRs (See \fICmdr - Private Specification Language\fR) which specifies
the common information which cannot have defaults, i\&.e\&.
.IP [1]
the name identifying it to the system,
.IP [2]
the help text describing it in informal speech, and, of course,
.IP [3]
the parameter specification itself, using the commands of this section\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS NAMING
.PP
We have two commands to influence the visible naming of all
\fIparameter\fRs\&.
.PP
As background, all \fIparameter\fRs are named, to properly
identify them within the framework and other Tcl code, i\&.e\&. in the
various callbacks and the \fIprivate\fR's action\&.
This \fIsystem name\fR has to be unique within the \fIprivate\fR a
\fIparameter\fR belongs to\&.
Beyond that however the visible (i\&.e\&. non-term state])
\fIparameter\fRs have to be identified by users within help texts,
and, in the case of \fIoption\fRs, for detection during the
\fIParsing\fR phase\&.
That is the visible naming, seen by a user of any application whose
command line processing is based on the Cmdr framework\&.
.TP
\fBlabel\fR \fItext\fR
This command declares the \fIparameter\fR's visible name, if
different from the \fIsystem name\fR used as the default\&. Note that
in most cases this default is good enough, obviating the need for this
command\&.
.sp
The only use case seen so far is when two semantically
equivalent \fIinput\fR and \fIoption\fR \fIparameter\fRs clash,
forcing the use of different system names due to the requirement for
their uniqueness, yet also use the same visible name and flag within
the help to highlight their connection and equivalence\&.
.TP
\fBalias\fR \fIname\fR
For \fIoption\fRs the \fBlabel\fR command and its default specifies
the name of the \fIprimary flag\fR recognized during the
\fIParsing\fR phase\&.
If that is not enough for a specific \fIoption\fR this command allows
the specification of any number additional flags to be recognized\&.
.sp
Note however that the framework automatically recognizes not
only the specified flag(s), but also all their unique prefixes,
obviating the need for this command in many cases\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS "GENERAL CONTROL"
.PP
The general handling of a \fIparameter\fR is influenced by
three commands:
.TP
\fBno-promotion\fR
When the framework encounters an unknown flag during the
\fIParsing\fR phase it will not unconditionally throw an error about
it, but first check if the next available \fIinput\fR
\fIparameter\fR (if any) could accept the flag string as its value,
per that \fIinput\fR's \fIvalidation type\fR, and if yes, does so\&.
.sp
This command causes the rejection of such flag strings by this
parameter on general principle, without having to validate it\&.
.sp
\fINote\fR that it is only useful for and applicable to
\fIinput\fR \fIparameters\fR\&.
.TP
\fBoptional\fR
This command marks the parameter as \fIoptional\fR, i\&.e\&. as something
the user may skip on the command line, with the application supplying
sensible defaults (See section \fBRepresentations\fR)\&.
This causes the framework to expend some effort in the \fIParsing\fR
phase to determine whether an argument word should be assigned to the
parameter, or not\&.
.sp
This setting is only applicable to \fIinput\fRs, as
\fIoption\fRs are optional by definition, and \fIstate\fR is hidden\&.
.TP
\fBtest\fR
This command is related to the above, switching the runtime from the
standard regime for acceptance (based on counting and thresholds) to a
different regime based on validation\&.
The details are explained in --TODO--(sectref:flow/parsing,flow/optional)--\&.
.TP
\fBundocumented\fR
This command excludes the \fIparameter\fR from the generated help\&.
.sp
Its main use case is the hiding of \fIoption\fRs giving an
application developer access to the internals of their application,
something a regular user has no need of, and doesn't have to know
about\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS REPRESENTATIONS
.PP
An important concept of \fIparameter\fRs is something taken up
from Tcl itself\&.
The differentation between \fIstring\fR and \fIinternal representations\fR\&.
Where Tcl uses \fIinternal representations\fR to speed up its
execution here this separation is that of between the information
delivered to the application by a user, and the application-specific
data structures behind them\&.
.PP
All \fIparameter\fRs will have an \fIinternal representation\fR\&.
This is usually derived from the \fIstring representation\fR
provided by the user\&.
The details of that process are explained in section \fBValidation\fR\&.
However we have cases where the user cannot specify a string
representation (\fIstate\fRs), or is allowed to choose not to
(optional \fIinput\fRs, \fIoption\fRs)\&.
For these cases three specification commands are made available
enabling us to programmatically choose the internal representation\&.
.TP
\fBdefault\fR \fIvalue\fR
This command specifies a constant default value for the internal
representation\&.
.TP
\fBgenerate\fR \fIcmdprefix\fR
This command specifies a callback to compute the default internal
representation at runtime\&. This is useful if the default is something
which cannot be captured as a fixed value\&. An example would be a
handle to some resource, or a dynamically created object\&.
.sp
The command prefix is invoked with a single argument, the
\fBcmdr::parameter\fR instance for which to generate the internal
representation\&.
.PP
.PP
The commands \fBdefault\fR and \fBgenerate\fR exclude each
other, i\&.e\&. only of them can be specified, but not both\&.
If neither are specified, and we need a default (see the cases above)
then a default is chosen by the framework itself, as per the two rules
below:
.IP [1]
Use the empty string for a \fBlist\fR parameter\&.
.IP [2]
Use the default value supplied by the chosen
\fIvalidation type\fR (See section \fBValidation\fR)\&.
.PP
.TP
\fBinteract\fR ?\fIprompt\fR?
This command actually does not specify an
\fIinternal representation\fR, but activates another method for the
user to specify the \fIstring representation\fR of the
\fIparameter\fR, outside of the command line\&.
As such it has priority over either \fBdefault\fR and \fBgenerate\fR,
and can be specified with either\&. A \fIparameter\fR marked with it
will interactively ask the user for a value if none was specified on
the command line\&.
.sp
The default for the \fIprompt\fR is derived from the
\fIparameter\fR's \fIsystem name\fR\&.
.PP
.PP
To recapitulate:
.IP [1]
A \fIstring representation\fR specified on the command line
has the highest priority and goes through the chosen
\fIvalidation type\fR to get the associated
\fIinternal representation\fR\&.
.IP [2]
If activated via \fBinteract\fR a small shell is run asking the
user for a value (or more, as per \fBlist\fR, see below)\&. The result
goes through the chosen \fIvalidation type\fR to get the associated
\fIinternal representation\fR\&.
.IP [3]
After that the \fIinternal representation\fR is either the
declared \fBdefault\fR value, or the result of invoking the
\fBgenerate\fR callback\&.
As \fIinternal representation\fRs the resulting values are
\fInot\fR run through the chosen \fIvalidation type\fR\&.
.PP
.TP
\fBlist\fR
This command marks the \fIparameter\fR as a list\&. In other words, its
\fIstring\fR and \fIinternal representation\fR is actually a list
of such, instead of a single value\&.
By default all parameters are scalar\&.
.sp
This affects the handling of the parameter by the
\fIParsing\fR phase, by \fBinteract\fR above, and the use of the
\fIvalidation type\fR\&.
The last two ask for multiple values, and feed the elements of the
\fIstring representation\fR separately through validation instead
of just the string value in one\&.
In the \fIParsing\fR phase treatment of \fIoption\fRs changes from
keeping only the last assigned value to the accumulation of all
values\&.
Similarly a list-\fIinput\fR takes all the remaining words on the
command line for itself instead of just the current word\&. Because of
this list-\fIinputs\fR are only allowed as the last \fIparameter\fR
of a \fIprivate\fR\&.
.PP
.PP
The last two specification commands dealing with the
representations control \fIwhen\fR the
\fIinternal representation\fR is created\&.
.TP
\fBdefered\fR
This command marks a \fIparameter\fR as \fIdefered\fR, causing its
\fIinternal representation\fR to be computed on first access to its
value\&. This is the default for \fIstate\fR parameters\&.
.TP
\fBimmediate\fR
This command marks a \fIparameter\fR as \fIimmediate\fR, causing its
\fIinternal representation\fR to be computed in the
\fICompletion\fR phase\&.
This is the default for \fIinput\fR and \fIoption\fR parameters\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS VALIDATION
.PP
The answer to the necessity of moving between the \fIstring\fR
and \fIinternal representations\fR described in the previous
section are the \fIvalidation types\fR\&.
Given a \fIstring representation\fR they either return the
associated \fIinternal representation\fR or raise an error,
signaling that the string was illegal\&. This part of their work, the
verification of the legality of the input string gave them their name\&.
.PP
The general concept of \fIvalidation types\fR was taken from
\fBsnit\fR, and modified to suit Cmdr\&.
Where snit's types expect only a single method to validate the input
Cmdr expects all types to support an ensemble of \fIfour\fR
methods\&.
One for the basic validation and transformation of the input, another
for the release of any internal representation so generated, plus two
more for delivery of a default representation and support for command
line completion\&.
.TP
\fBvalidate\fR \fIcmdprefix\fR
This command specifies a \fIvalidation type\fR for the
\fIparameter\fR, in the form of a command prefix (or the name of one
of the builtin types, see package \fBcmdr::validate\fR)\&.
The set of methods this callback has to support, their signatures,
etc\&. are all explained in \fICmdr - Writing custom validation types\fR\&. This document
contains the implementation of the standard boolean validation type as
an example as well\&.
.sp
Because of the same necessity all \fIparameter\fRs must have a
\fIvalidation type\fR assigned to them, and the system will choose
which, if the user did not\&. This choice is made as per the six rules
below and always returns one of the standard types implemented by
package \fBcmdr::validate\fR\&.
.RS
.IP [1]
Use \fBidentity\fR if a \fBgenerate\fR callback is specified\&.
.IP [2]
Use \fBboolean\fR  if no \fBdefault\fR is specified and the parameter is an \fIoption\fR\&.
.IP [3]
Use \fBidentity\fR if no \fBdefault\fR is specified and the parameter is an \fIinput\fR\&.
.IP [4]
Use \fBboolean\fR  if the specified \fBdefault\fR value is a Tcl boolean\&.
.IP [5]
Use \fBinteger\fR  if the specified \fBdefault\fR value is a Tcl integer\&.
.IP [6]
Use \fBidentity\fR as fallback of last resort\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBpresence\fR
This command is best discussed as part of the wider area of
\fIboolean\fR \fIoption\fRs, i\&.e\&. \fIoption\fRs with the standard
\fIvalidation type\fR \fBboolean\fR assigned to them\&. These have
associated special behaviours, both in the handling of the
specification, and in the \fIParsing\fR phase\&.
.sp
First, normal boolean options\&.
They have automatic aliases declared for them, derived from their
primary flag\&.
An option named "foo" will have an alias of "no-foo", and the
reverse\&.
In the \fIParsing\fR phase the "foo" and "no-foo" flags have inverse
semantics, and both are allowed to occur without option argument
following the flag\&.
This is in contrast to all other \fIoption\fRs which must have such
an argument\&. The parser essentially uses the \fIvalidation type\fR
to decide if the word after the flag is a proper boolean value, or
not, i\&.e\&. an argument to assign to the \fIparameter\fR, or not\&.
.sp
Now \fBpresence\fR declares a variant of the above, a boolean
option \fIwithout\fR the automatic aliases, and \fInever\fR taking
an argument during parsing\&.
Its mere \fIpresence\fR on the command line will set its
\fIparameter\fR\&.
Their \fBdefault\fR value is consequently fixed to \fBfalse\fR as
well\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS SIGNALING
Of the four callbacks supported by parameters the first two,
\fBgenerate\fR and \fBvalidate\fR have been described already, in the
sections \fBRepresentations\fR and \fBValidation\fR,
respectively\&.
.PP
This section explains the commonalities between the callbacks
in general, and the last two, for notifications about state changes in
detail\&.
.PP
All callbacks are treated as command prefixes, not scripts\&.
There are no placeholder substitutions, only arguments added to each
command prefix on invokation\&. This does not harm the generality of the
system, as complex scripts can be used via procedures or equivalents
(i\&.e\&. \fBapply\fR)\&.
.PP
The two callbacks not yet described are the state-change
callbacks through which the framework can actively drive parts of the
application while processing the command line, whereas normally the
application drives access to parameters through their methods\&.
.TP
\fBwhen-complete\fR \fIcmdprefix\fR
This command declares the state-change callback to invoke when the
\fIinternal representation\fR of the \fIparameter\fR is generated
from the \fIstring representation\fR, or the various ways of
getting a default\&.
.sp
The callback is invoked with two arguments, the
\fBcmdr::parameter\fR instance of the changed \fIparameter\fR,
and its \fIinternal representation\fR, in this order\&.
.TP
\fBwhen-set\fR \fIcmdprefix\fR
This command declares the state-change callback to invoke when the
\fIstring representation\fR of the \fIparameter\fR is set during
command line parsing\&.
.sp
The callback is invoked with two arguments, the
\fBcmdr::parameter\fR instance of the changed \fIparameter\fR,
and its \fIstring representation\fR, in this order\&.
.PP
Due to their nature these callbacks are invoked at runtime during
either the \fIParsing\fR, \fICompletion\fR, or \fIExecution\fR
phases\&.
The details are shown in the table below\&. The specification commands
influencing the timing, i\&.e\&. forcing the use in a specific phase are
shown in the intersection of callback and phase\&.
