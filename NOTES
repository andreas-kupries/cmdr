"Global" options.

(1) Specification
	Officers are extended
**	(a)	with a spec command 'option', equivalent to the same
		for 'private's.
**	(b)	with a cmdr::config instance.

(2) Semantics
**	The global options of an officer O are automatically visible
	to all its sub-ordinates.

**	This is done by importing them into the cmdr::config of the
	sub-ordinate at the time it is processing its own specification.

**	This means that sub-ordinates _cannot_ specify their own
	options with the same name.

TODO	An exception is the generation of help, where the options of
	the officer are only seen by the officer itself, and none of
	the sub-ordinates. This will unclutter the individual commands
	which otherwise would show all the .use'd options.

**	The import also means that the backend code can access these
	option parameters directly, without having to walk up in the
	command tree. There is no need to extend officers with
	accessor commands.

(2) Processing
**	(a)	Setup of officers and privates imports the parameters
		of their direct superior officer. As that officer
		in turn imported from their own superior all global
		options automatically spread down the entire tree.

TODO	(b)	Cmdline processing in officers is extended to check
		for options and handle them if known, or throw an
		error if not.

(3) Help
TODO	(a)	Imported parameters of an officer or private are
		excluded from the generated help.

TODO	(b)	The help structure is extended so that officers can
		declare the options they understand.
