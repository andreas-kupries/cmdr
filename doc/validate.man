[include parts/welcome.inc]

This internal package implements the twelve standard validation types
shown below. The [cmd validate] command of the parameter declaration
DSL can use these by name. Non-standard types have to provide a proper
command prefix instead.

[para] Readers interested in writing their own custom validation types
should read [term [vset TITLE_DEV_VT]].
