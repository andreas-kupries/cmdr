[para] This package provides the validation type
[cmd ::cmdr::validate::time] which accepts timestamps in ISO 8601
syntax.

[para] The internal representation is the epoch for the validated
input.

[para] The type has no input completion.

[para] The details of the exported standard API can be found in
[term [vset TITLE_DEV_VT]]. The chosen default is "now".

[para] A single non-standard method is provided:

[list_begin definitions][comment {-- begin api definitions --}]
[comment {- - -- --- ----- -------- ------------- ---------------------}]
[call [cmd ::cmdr::validate::time] [method 2external] [arg epoch]]

This method converts the epoch of a time to the form %H:%M:%S and
returns the conversion result as its own.
