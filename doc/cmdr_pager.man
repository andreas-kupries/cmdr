This package provides a single utility command to manage the automatic
paging of long output, like [vset PROJECT]'s automatic help.

[call [cmd ::cmdr::pager] [method text]]

When invoked this command either simply prints the [arg text] to stdout,
or invokes an external pager application to manage the output.

[para] The pager is only invoked when

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum] Stdout is a terminal, and
[enum] The text does not fit into the height of the terminal, and
[enum] a pager application could be found.
[list_end]

[para] If any of the above conditions fail the text is simply printed.

[para] When the command comes to the third condition above it will look
for the pager specified in the environment variable [const PAGER] first,
and then [const less] and [const more], in this order.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def string text]
The text to print or page.
[list_end]

[para] The result of the command is the empty string.
