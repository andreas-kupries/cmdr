This internal package implements the four standard help formats

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum] [const full],
[enum] [const short],
[enum] [const list], and
[enum] [const by-category].
[list_end]

[para] It provides a single utility command used by the other parts of
the framework to add a [syscmd help] command to any
[package cmdr::actor] requiring such.

[call [cmd ::cmdr::help] [method auto] [arg actor]]

When invoked this command extends the [arg actor] with a [const help]
command. The result of the command is the empty string.

[para] The inserted command will accept all known format names as
options, enabling the user to choose the form of the help. By default
the format [const by-category] will be used, except if a command name
was given to [syscmd help], then the default will be [const full].

[para] An additional option accepted by [syscmd help] is
[const --width], giving the user control over the length of lines
in the help. By default help will be formatted to the width of the
terminal.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def [package cmdr::actor] actor]
The [package cmdr::actor] instance to be extended with [syscmd help].
[list_end]
[list_end]

[section {Format Notes}]

The format [const by-category] looks for and uses the block
[const *category-order*] for when the user wishes to override the
natural (alphabetical) order of display for the toplevel sections.

[para] This block has to be defined in the root of the command hierarchy.

@EDIT --TODO-- details of the *category-order* definition.
