The cmdr framework is a set of 12 related Tcl packages for the easy
specification of the interfaces of command line applications.

This means the declaration of the set of commands to be provided by an
application, and their parameters, be they options or positional
inputs.

At runtime the internals of the framework, guided by the chosen
specification, handle the bulk of processing [var \$::argv]. This
covers determining the requested command, mapping argument words to
command parameters, and validating them.

Additional features of the runtime are an integrated help system and
interactive command line shells with basic command and argument
completion.
