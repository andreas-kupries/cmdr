[para] This package provides the validation type
[cmd ::cmdr::validate::time::minute] which accepts timestamps with
minute precision in ISO 8601 syntax (limited to without seconds), or
as integer offset in minutes from midnight (modulo 24 hours).

[para] The internal representation is the offset in minutes from
midnight for the validated input.

[para] The type has no input completion.

[para] The details of the exported standard API can be found in
[term [vset TITLE_DEV_VT]]. The chosen default is "now" to the minute.

[para] A single non-standard method is provided:

[list_begin definitions][comment {-- begin api definitions --}]
[comment {- - -- --- ----- -------- ------------- ---------------------}]
[call [cmd ::cmdr::validate::time] [method 2external] [arg epoch]]

This method converts the offset in minutes from midnight of a time to
the form %H:%M and returns the conversion result as its own.
