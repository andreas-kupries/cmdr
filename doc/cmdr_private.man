This package implements [emph privates], the leaves of command
hierarchies.  While each private can execute only a single option they
have parameters, i.e. arguments and options with which to configure
the behaviour of their action.

[comment @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@]
[section {Class API}]

The class API is not public. It is used internally by the framework
when parsing a command hierarchy specification to create the necessary
private instances.

[para] It is described here for use by developers maintaining,
modifying and extending the framework itself. A user of the framework
has no need for it.

[call [cmd ::cmdr::private] [method new] [arg super] [arg name] [arg arguments] [arg action]]

Create an auto-named instance of [class cmdr::private].
[para] [emph {Not used}].

[comment {- - -- --- ----- -------- -------------}]
[call [cmd ::cmdr::private] [method create] [arg obj] [arg super] [arg name] [arg arguments] [arg action]]

Create a new instance of [class cmdr::private], named [arg obj].
Used by the DSL processing parts of the framework to instantiate privates.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def object super]
The instance command of the actor (officer actually) which contain the private.

[arg_def string name]
The user-visible name of the command.

[arg_def script arguments]
The specification of the private's parameters.
Please read [term [vset TITLE_DSL]], section --TODO-- for the details.

[arg_def cmd-prefix action]
The command prefix to invoke when this private is selected for
execution.  It takes a single argument, the instance command of the
hidden [package cmdr::config] container holding the private's
parameters. The result of the action, if there is any, is ignored by
the framework.

[section {Instance API}]

The instance API is not public. It is used internally by the framework
when during the processing of a command line at runtime

parsing a command hierarchy specification to create the necessary
private instances.

[para] It is described here for use by developers maintaining,
modifying and extending the framework itself. A user of the framework
has no need for it, although they have indirect access through
parameters and their container.

[call [cmd <private>] [method complete-words] [arg parse]]

This method is given the completion state [arg parse] of a partial
command line and returns a list of strings which are the valid
completions at this point.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def dict parse]
A dictionary holding the current completion state of a partial command
line.

[para] -- TODO -- Describe the state fields and their meaning.

[call [cmd <private>] [method do] [opt [arg word]...]]

This method parses the [arg word]s of the command line, matching them
to the parameters of the private, be they arguments, or options. When
done without error it invokes the action of the private with the
filled container of parameters.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def string word]
The words of the command line to parse and match to parameters.
[list_end][comment arguments]

[call [cmd <private>] [method ehandler] [arg cmd]]

This method specifies a command prefix to wrap around the parsing of
the command line for the private, and the execution of its action.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def cmd-prefix cmd]
A command prefix taking a single argument, a script. The command
prefix has to execute this script in its caller's context. The script
will parse words for the private,m and perform its action. The command
prefix then has the responsbility to perform any custom cleanup action
required by the application using the framework to prevent leakage of
data between multiple commands executed one after the other (i.e. in
an interactive shell run by the framework).

[call [cmd <private>] [method help] [opt [arg prefix]]]

This method returns the help information for the private and its
parameters. The [arg prefix], if specified provides the name of the
private within the help data. It defaults to the empty string.

The result of the command is a structure of the form
described in section [sectref {Help Information}].

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def string prefix]
The name to use for the private within the generated help.
[list_end][comment arguments]

[comment {- - -- --- ----- -------- -------------}]
[call [cmd <private>] [method unknown] [arg m] [opt [arg word]...]]

This method overrides the standard behaviour for unknown methods.
Instead of throwing an error they are routed to the hidden container
of the private's parameters, of class [package cmdr::config].

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def string m]    The name of the unknown method.
[arg_def string word] The argument (one or more) of the unknown method.
[list_end][comment arguments]
