[para] This package provides the validation type
[cmd ::cmdr::validate::weekday] which accepts weekdays as names and
numbers.

[para] The internal representation is the numeric weekday for the
validated input where [const 1] to [const 7] map to Monday to Sunday.

[para] The type has no input completion.

[para] The details of the exported standard API can be found in
[term [vset TITLE_DEV_VT]]. The chosen default is "today's weekday".

[para] A single non-standard method is provided:

[list_begin definitions][comment {-- begin api definitions --}]
[comment {- - -- --- ----- -------- ------------- ---------------------}]
[call [cmd ::cmdr::validate::time] [method 2external] [arg weekday]]

This method converts the numeric weekday to the form %A and returns
the conversion result as its own.

[comment {- - -- --- ----- -------- ------------- ---------------------}]
[list_end][comment {-- end api definitions --}]
